/* We to model the Yubikey protocol, described in
*  http://www.yubico.com/documentation
*  http://www.yubico.com/developers-intro
*  In this version, we assume the Authentication Server to be under the
*  control of the attacker. We investigate the secrecy of keys in case the
*  Authentication Server can protect the keys by encrypting them using a
*  Hardware Token called YubiHSM, see:
*  TODO URL will follow
*  This is simplified version, in particular:
*  - timestamps are not modelled
*  - we do not distinguish the session and token counter. We described them
*    as one single counter, that represents the pair (session counter, token
*    counter) with a lexicographical oder on the pair.
*  - we model encryption in more detail than the Theory Yubikey. However,
*    we use a very much simplified model of XOR
*  - we assume the YubiHSM to be in a configuration where only the flags
*    YSM_AEAD_RANDOM_GENERATE and
*    YSM_AEAD_YUBIKEY_OTP_DECODE
*    are activated.

 * used keyhandle and nonce that determined the keystream. (Similar for
