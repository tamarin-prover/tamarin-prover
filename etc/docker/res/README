Use the following alias to give the image access to your host's current working
dir (at the time of calling) and forward port 3001:

alias docker-tamarin-prover='docker run --rm -it -p 3001:3001 -v "$PWD:$PWD" -w "$PWD" tamarin-prover/tamarin:latest tamarin-prover'

Then run "docker-tamarin-prover". Remember to use the "-i" flag in tamarin's
interactive mode to accept clients on all interfaces, as the docker host is not
localhost to the guest:

docker-tamarin-prover interactive . -i='*4'
