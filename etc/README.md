Repository for text editor syntax highlighting.


## Syntax for Vim

Although this repo contains syntax files for other editors it should work with 
plugin-managers such as Vundle and Pathogen. Just add this line to the 
`.vimrc`:

```vimrc
Plugin "tamarin-prover/editors"
```

The files

  - `filetype.vim`
  - `syntax/`

are for use with Vim.
