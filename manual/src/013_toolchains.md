==========

There are multiple tools that use Tamarin as a backend.

Alice&Bob input 
---------------

There exists a tool that translates Alice&Bob-specifications to Tamarin:

Tamarin-Troop
---------------
If you want to export a SAPIC file to multiple provers, and find out
which prover works fastest for a lemma in the file, the python
script *tamarin-troop* can help you.

First, *tamarin-troop* will export your SAPIC file and lemma to the provers
you choose. Currently, it supports ProVerif, Deepsec, GSVerif, and Tamarin.
Then, it will run the provers concurrently, report the result and the time
the first prover took to finish, and abort the calls to the other provers. 

To get *tamarin-troop* copy `etc/tamarin-troop.py` into your `$PATH`.

How to use Tamarin-Troop
---------------
*Tamarin-troop* requires a python 3 installation to work. Moreover, it
expects the provers to be in your path under their usual names (i.e
`tamarin-prover` for tamarin, `proverif` for ProVerif etc.)

We now go over its most important command-line parameters and their
semantics. Invoke 
```
    ./tamarin-troop.py --help
```
for more information.

  - **-file path_to_your_sapic_file** is the only required argument.
    This is the path to your SAPIC file.

  - **-t arg1 arg2 ...** tells *tamarin-troop* to concurrently call
    the Tamarin-prover on the SAPIC file. For each argument,
    *tamarin-troop* will call Tamarin with the argument.
    The double-dashes are added by *tamarin-troop*.
    There is no need to type them out.
    You can give this parameter multiple times.
    If you do, *tamarin-troop* makes multiple calls to
    Tamarin using the cross-product of the given arguments.

    For instance,
    ```
    ./tamarin-troop.py -file nsl-no_as-untagged.spthy -t help auto-sources
    ```
    results in the following calls to Tamarin:
    ```
    Executing 'tamarin-prover nsl-no_as-untagged.spthy --prove --help'
    Executing 'tamarin-prover nsl-no_as-untagged.spthy --prove --auto-sources'
    ```
    The call
    ```
    ./tamarin-troop.py -file nsl-no_as-untagged.spthy -t help auto-sources -t help auto-sources
    ```
    leads to the following calls:
    ```
    Executing 'tamarin-prover nsl-no_as-untagged.spthy --prove --help --help'
    Executing 'tamarin-prover nsl-no_as-untagged.spthy --prove --help --auto-sources'
    Executing 'tamarin-prover nsl-no_as-untagged.spthy --prove --auto-sources --help'
    Executing 'tamarin-prover nsl-no_as-untagged.spthy --prove --auto-sources --auto-sources'
    ```
      
  - **-p arg1 arg2 ...** tells *tamarin-troop* to concurrently call
    ProVerif on the translated SAPIC file. *Tamarin-troop* stores
    the translated SAPIC file in the directory it resides in. The
    generated file is called **input_file_proverif.pv**; where
    **input_file** is the original SAPIC file.
    The semantics are the same as **-t**.

  - **-d arg1 arg2 ...** tells *tamarin-troop* to concurrently call
    Deepsec on the translated SAPIC file. Again, an intermediate file
    is generated by *tamarin-troop*. The same naming convention applies.
    The semantics are the same as **-t** and **-p**.

  - **-l lemma1 lemma2 ...** tells *tamarin-troop* to export the
    lemmas **lemma1 lemma2 ...**. For calls to Tamarin this is
    done by adding the **--prove=lemmaX** flag. For each lemma
    *tamarin-troop* will make one call to Tamarin. For ProVerif
    and Deepsec, *tamarin-troop* uses the **--lemma=lemmaX**
    flag to only export a single lemma to the ProVerif/Deepsec
    file.

    If the user gives no lemma, *tamarin-troop* exports
    **ALL** lemmas to ProVerif/Deepsec, and tries
    to prove all lemmas with Tamarin. However,
    *tamarin-troop* currently assumes that there is only
    one lemma/query in a file if no lemmas are given.
    Thus, not specifying any lemmas only makes sense
    if the original SAPIC file contains exactly one
    lemma.

  - **-H {s,S,c,C,i,I} ...** tells *tamarin-troop* to call
    Tamarin with the given heuristics. If other arguments
    for Tamarin are supplied via the **-t** parameters,
    the before mentioned cross-product semantics apply.

  - **-D Flag1 Flag2 ...** tells *tamarin-troop* to use
    the flags **Flag1 Flag2...** when calling Tamarin
    on the SAPIC file, and when generating the ProVerif/
    Deepsec files.

  - **--diff** tells *tamarin-troop* to use Tamarins
    **--diff** flag for calls to Tamarin and ProVerif/
    Deepsec file generation.

  - **--gs** tells *tamarin-troop* to use the GSVerif
    pre-processor on a ProVerif file before calling
    ProVerif.

  - **-to** sets a timeout for the calls *tamarin-troop*
    starts. The default is 5 seconds.
