Model Specification using Rules {#sec:model-specification}
===================

In this section, we now provide an informal description of the
underlying model. The full details of this model can be found
in [@benediktthesis].

Tamarin models are specified using three main ingredients:

   1. Rules
   2. Facts
   3. Terms

We have already seen the definition of terms in the previous section. Here we
will discuss facts and rules, and illustrate their use with respect to the Naxos
protocol, displayed below.

![The Naxos protocol](../images/naxos.png){ width=80% }\

<!-- **FIX Cas: Picture should be updated and use vector graphics, ideally.**
-->

In this protocol, each party `x` has a long-term private key `lkx` and a
corresponding public key `pkx = 'g'^lkx`, where `'g'` is a generator of the
Diffie-Hellman group. Because `'g'` can be public, we model it as a public
constant. Two different hash functions `h1` and `h2` are used.

To start a session, the initiator `I` first creates a fresh nonce `eskI`, also
known as `I`’s ephemeral (private) key. He then concatenates `eskI` with `I`’s
long-term private key `lkI`, hashes the result using the hash function `h1`, and
sends `'g'^h1(eskI ,lkI)` to the responder. The responder `R` stores the received
value in a variable `X`, computes a similar value based on his own nonce `eskR`
and long-term private key `lkR`, and sends the result to the initiator, who
stores the received value in the variable `Y`. Finally, both parties compute a
session key (`kI` and `kR`, respectively) whose computation includes their own
long-term private keys, such that only the intended partner can compute the same
key.

Note that the messages exchanged are not authenticated as the recipients cannot
verify that the expected long-term key was used in the construction of the
message. The authentication is implicit and only guaranteed through ownership of
the correct key. Explicit authentication (e.g., the intended partner was
recently alive or agrees on some values) is commonly achieved in authenticated
key exchange protocols by adding a key-confirmation step, where the parties
exchange a MAC of the exchanged messages that is keyed with (a variant of) the
computed session key.


Rules{#sec:rules}
-----

We use multiset rewriting to specify the concurrent execution of
the protocol and the adversary.  Multiset rewriting is a formalism that is commonly used to model
concurrent systems since it naturally supports independent transitions.

A multiset rewriting system defines a transition system, where, in our
case,
the transitions will be labeled. The system's state is a multiset (bag) of
facts. We will explain the types of facts and their use below.

A rewrite rule in Tamarin has a name and three parts, each of which
is a sequence of facts: one for the rule's left-hand side, one labelling the
transition (which we call 'action facts'),  and one for the rule's right-hand side.
For example:

	rule MyRule1:
	  [ ] --[ L('x') ]-> [ F('1','x'), F('2','y') ]

	rule MyRule2:
	  [ F(u,v) ] --[ M(u,v) ]-> [ H(u), G('3',h(v)) ]

For now, we will ignore the action facts (`L(...)` and `M(...)`) and return to
them when discussing properties in the next section. If a rule is not
labelled by action facts, the arrow notation `--[ ]->` can be abbreviated to `-->`.

The rule names are only used for referencing specific rules. They have no
specific meaning and can be chosen arbitrarily, as long as each rule has a
unique name.

### Executions

The initial state of the transition system is the empty multiset.

The rules define how the system can make a transition to a new state. A
rule can be applied to a state if it can be instantiated such that its left hand
side is contained in the current state. In this case, the left-hand side facts
are removed from the state, and replaced by the instantiated right hand side.

For example, in the initial state, `MyRule1` can be instantiated repeatedly.

For any instantiation of `MyRule1`,
this leads to follow-up  state that contains `F('1','x')` and `F('2','y')`. `MyRule2`
cannot be applied in the initial state since it contains no `F` facts.  In the
successor state, the rule `MyRule2` can now be applied twice. It can be
instantiated either by `u` equal to `'1'` (with `v` equal to `'x'`) or to `'2'` (with `v`  equal to `'y'`). Each of
these instantiations leads to a new successor state.

### Using 'let' binding in rules for local macros {#sec:let-rules}

When modeling more complex protocols,  a term
may occur multiple times (possibly as a subterm) within the same rule. To make such
specifications more readable, Tamarin offers support for `let ... in`, as in the
following example:

	rule MyRuleName:
		let foo1 = h(bar)
		    foo2 = <'bars', foo1>
		    ...
		    var5 = pk(~x)
		in
		[ ... ] --[ ... ]-> [ ... ]

Such let-binding expressions  can be used to specify local term macros within the context of a
rule.  Each macro should occur on a separate line and defines a
substitution:
the left-hand side of the `=` sign must be a variable and
the right-hand side is an arbitrary term. The rule will be interpreted after
substituting all variables occurring in the let by their right-hand
sides.
As the above example indicates, macros may use the left-hand sides of
earlier defined macros.


### Global macros {#sec:macros}


Sometimes we want to use the same let binding(s) in multiples rules. In such a
case, we can use the `macros` keyword to define global macros, which are
applied to all rules. Consider the following example:

	macros: macro1(x) = h(x), macro2(x, y) = <x, y>, ..., macro7() = $A

Here `macro1` is the name of the first macro, and `x` is its the parameter.
The second macro is called `macro2` and has two parameters `x` and `y`.
The last macro `macro7` has no parameters.
The the term on the right of the `=` sign is the output of the macro. It can be
any term built from the functions defined in the equational theory and the
parameters of the macro.

To use a macro in a rule, we can use the macro like a function inside terms.
For example

	[ In(macro1(~ltk)) ] --[ ... ]-> [ Out(macro2(pkA, pkB)) ]

will become

	[ In(h(~ltk)) ] --[ ... ]-> [ Out(<pkA, pkB>) ]

after the above macros have been applied.

A macro can call a second macro, if the second one was defined before.
For example, one can define the following two macros:

	macros: innerMacro(x, y) = <x, y>, hashMacro(x, y) = h(innerMacro(x, y))

However, the following snippet would result in an error

	macros: hashMacro(x, y) = h(innerMacro(x, y)), innerMacro(x, y) = <x, y>

as `innerMacro` is not yet defined when `hashMacro` is defined.

Macros only apply to rules, and are shown in interactive mode together with the
protocol rules.
When exporting a theory, Tamarin will export the original rules (before the
macros were applied) and the macros.

Facts
-----

Facts are of the form `F(t1,...,tn)` for a fact symbol `F` and terms `ti`. They
have a fixed arity (in this case `n`). Note that if a Tamarin model uses the same
fact with two different arities, Tamarin will report an error.

There are three types of special facts built in to Tamarin. These are used to
model interaction with the untrusted network and to model the generation of
unique fresh (random) values.

`In`

:	This fact is used to model a party receiving a message from the
	untrusted network that is controlled by a Dolev-Yao adversary, and can
	only occur on the left-hand side of a rewrite rule.

`Out`

:	This fact is used to model a party sending a message to the untrusted
	network that is controlled by a Dolev-Yao adversary, and can only occur on
	the right-hand side of a rewrite rule.

`Fr`

:	This fact must be used when generating fresh (random) values, and can
	only occur on the left-hand side of a rewrite rule, where its argument is the
	fresh term. Tamarin's underlying execution model has a built-in rule for
	generating instances of `Fr(x)` facts, and also ensures that each
	instance produces a term (instantiating `x`) that is different from all others.

For the above three facts, Tamarin has built-in rules. In particular, there is a
fresh rule that produces unique `Fr(...)` facts, and there is a set of rules for
adversary knowledge derivation, which consume `Out(...)` facts and produce
`In(...)` facts.

### Linear versus persistent facts

The facts mentioned above are called 'linear facts'. They are not only
produced by rules, they also can be consumed by rules.
Hence they might appear in one state
but not in the next.

In contrast, some facts in our models will never be removed from the state once
they are introduced. Modeling this using linear facts would
require that every rule that has such a fact in
the left-hand-side, also has an exact copy of this fact in the right-hand
side. While there is no fundamental problem with this modeling in theory, it is
inconvenient for the user and it also might lead Tamarin to explore rule
instantiations that are irrelevant for tracing such facts in practice, which
may even lead to non-termination.

For the above two reasons, we now introduce 'persistent facts', which
are never removed from the state. We denote these facts by prefixing
them with a bang (`!`).

Facts always start with an upper-case letter and need not  be
declared explicitly. If their name is prefixed with an exclamation mark `!`,
then they are persistent. Otherwise, they are linear. Note that every
fact name must be used consistently; i.e., it must always be used with
the same arity, case, persistence, and multiplicity. Otherwise, Tamarin complains
that the theory is not well-formed.

Comparing linear and persistent fact behaviour we note that if there is a
persistent fact in some rule's premise, then Tamarin will consider all rules that
produce this persistent fact in their conclusion as the source. Usually though,
there are few such rules (most often just a single one), which simplifies the
reasoning. For linear facts, particularly those that are used in many rules
(and kept static), obviously there are many rules with the fact in their
conclusion (all of them!). Thus, when looking for a source in any premise,
all such rules need to be considered, which is clearly less efficient and
non-termination-prone as mentioned above. Hence, when trying to model facts that
are never consumed, the use of persistent facts is preferred.

### Embedded restrictions{#sec:embeddedrestrictions}

A frequently used trick when modelling protocols is to enforce a
restriction
on the trace once a certain rule is invoked, for instance if
the step represented by the rule requires another step at some later point in time, e.g., to model a reliable channel.
[We explain what restriction are later](007_property-specification.html#sec:restrictions),
but roughly speaking, they specify constraints that a protocol execution should
uphold.

This can be done by hand, namely by specifying a restriction that refers to an `action
fact` unique to this rule, or by using embedded restrictions like this:

```
rule B:
    [In(x), In(y)] --[ _restrict( formula )]-> []
```

where `formula` is a restriction. Note that embedded restrictions currently
are only available in trace mode.

Modeling protocols
------------------

There are several ways in which the execution of security protocols can be
defined, e.g., as in [@opsem2012]. In Tamarin, there is no pre-defined protocol
concept  and the user is free to model them as she or he chooses.
Below we give an example of how protocols can be modeled
and discuss alternatives afterwards.

### Public-key infrastructure

In the Tamarin model, there is no pre-defined notion of public key
infrastructure (PKI). A pre-distributed PKI with asymmetric keys for each party
can be modeled by a single rule that generates a key for a party. The party's
identity and public/private keys are then stored as facts in the state, enabling
protocol rules to retrieve them. For the public key, we commonly use the `Pk`
fact, and for the corresponding long-term private key we use the `Ltk` fact.
Since these
facts will only be used by other rules to retrieve the keys, but never updated,
we model them as persistent facts. We use the abstract function `pk(x)` to
denote the public key corresponding to the private key `x`, leading to the
following rule. Note that we also directly give all public keys to the attacker,
modeled by the `Out` on the right-hand side.

	rule Generate_key_pair:
	  [ Fr(~x) ]
	  -->
	  [ !Pk($A,pk(~x))
	  , Out(pk(~x))
	  , !Ltk($A,~x)
	  ]

Some protocols, such as Naxos, rely on the algebraic properties of the key
pairs. In many DH-based protocols, the public key is $g^x$ for the private key
$x$, which enables exploiting the commutativity of the exponents to establish
keys. In this case, we specify the following rule instead.

	rule Generate_DH_key_pair:
	  [ Fr(~x) ]
	  -->
	  [ !Pk($A,'g'^~x)
	  , Out('g'^~x)
	  , !Ltk($A,~x)
	  ]

### Modeling a protocol step

Protocols describe the behavior of agents in the system. Agents can perform
protocol steps, such as receiving a message and responding by sending a message,
or starting a session.

### Modeling the Naxos responder role

We first model the responder role, which is simpler than the
initiator role since it can be done in one rule.

The protocol uses a Diffie-Hellman exponentiation, and two hash functions `h1`
and `h2`, which we must declare. We can model this using:

	builtins: diffie-hellman

and

	functions: h1/1
	functions: h2/1

Without any further equations, a function declared in this fashion
will behave as a one-way function.


Each time a responder thread of an agent `$R` receives a message, it will
generate a fresh value `~eskR`, send a response message, and compute a key `kR`.
We can model receiving a message by specifying an `In` fact on the left-hand
side of a rule. To model the generation of a fresh value, we require it to be
generated by the built-in fresh rule.

Finally, the rule depends on the actor's long-term
private key, which we can obtain from the persistent fact generated by the
`Generate_DH_key_pair` rule presented previously.

The response message is an exponentiation of `g` to the power of a computed
hash function. Since the hash function is unary (arity one), if we want to invoke it
on the concatenation of two messages, we model them as a pair `<x,y>` which
will be used as the single argument of `h1`.

Thus, an initial formalization of this rule might be as follows:

        rule NaxosR_attempt1:
                [
                  In(X),
                  Fr(~eskR),
                  !Ltk($R, lkR)
                ]
                -->
                [
                  Out( 'g'^h1(< ~eskR, lkR >) )
                ]

However, the responder also computes a session key `kR`. Since the
session key does not affect the sent or received messages, we can omit
it from the left-hand side and the right-hand side of the rule. However,
later we will want to make a statement about the session key in the security
property. We therefore add the computed key to the actions:

        rule NaxosR_attempt2:
                [
                  In(X),
                  Fr(~eskR),
                  !Ltk($R, lkR)
                ]
                --[ SessionKey($R, kR ) ]->
                [
                  Out( 'g'^h1(< ~eskR, lkR >) )
                ]

The computation of `kR` is not yet specified in the above. We could replace
`kR` in the above rule by its full unfolding, but this would decrease
readability.  Instead, we use  let binding to avoid
duplication and reduce possible mismatches. Additionally, for the
key computation we need the public key of the communication partner `$I`, which
we bind to a unique thread identifier `~tid`; we use the
resulting action fact
to specify security properties, as we will see in the next
section.  This leads to:

        rule NaxosR_attempt3:
          let
              exR = h1(< ~eskR, lkR >)
              hkr = 'g'^exR
              kR  = h2(< pkI^exR, X^lkR, X^exR, $I, $R >)
          in
           [
               In(X),
               Fr( ~eskR ),
               Fr( ~tid ),
               !Ltk($R, lkR),
               !Pk($I, pkI)
           ]
           --[ SessionKey( ~tid, $R, $I, kR ) ]->
           [
               Out( hkr )
           ]

The above rule models the responder role accurately, and computes the
appropriate key.

We note one further optimization that helps Tamarin's backwards search. In
`NaxosR_attempt3`, the rule specifies that `lkR` might be instantiated with any
term, hence also non-fresh terms. However, since the key generation rule is the
only rule that produces `Ltk` facts, and it will always use a fresh value for
the key, it is clear that in any reachable state of the system, `lkR` can only
become instantiated by fresh values. We can therefore mark `lkR` as being of
sort fresh, therefore replacing it by `~lkR`.^[Note that in contrast,
replacing `X` by `~X` would change the interpretation of the model, effectively
restricting the instantiations of the rule to those where `X` is a fresh
value.]

~~~~ {.tamarin slice="code/Naxos.spthy" lower=16 upper=32}
~~~~

The above rule suffices to model basic security properties, as we will see later.

### Modeling the Naxos initiator role

The initiator role of the Naxos protocol consists of sending a message and waiting
for the response. While the initiator is waiting
for a response, other agents might also perform steps. We therefore
model the initiator using two rules.^[This modeling approach, as with the
responder, is similar to the approach taken in cryptographic security models in
the game-based setting, where each rule corresponds to a "query".]

The first rule models an agent starting the initiator role, generating a fresh
value, and sending the appropriate message. As before, we use let binding
to simplify the presentation and use `~lkI` instead of `lkI` since we know that
`!Ltk` facts are only produced with a fresh value as the second argument.

        rule NaxosI_1_attempt1:
          let exI = h1(<~eskI, ~lkI >)
              hkI = 'g'^exI
          in
           [   Fr( ~eskI ),
               !Ltk( $I, ~lkI ) ]
           -->
           [   Out( hkI ) ]

#### Using state facts to model progress

After triggering the previous rule, an initiator will wait for the response
message. We still need to model the second part, in which the response is
received and the key is computed. To model the second part of the initiator
rule, we must be able to specify that it was preceded by the first part and
with specific parameters. Intuitively, we must store in the state of the
transition system that there is an initiator thread that has performed the
first send with specific parameters, so it can continue where it left off.

To model this, we introduce a new fact, which we often refer to as a *state
fact*: a fact that indicates that a certain process or thread is at a specific
point in its execution, effectively operating both as a program counter and as
a container for the contents of the memory of the process or thread.  Since
there can be any number of initiators in parallel, we need to provide a unique
handle for each of their state facts.

Below we provide an updated version of the initiator's first rule that produces
a state fact `Init_1` and introduces a unique thread identifier `~tid` for each
instance of the rule.

~~~~ {.tamarin slice="code/Naxos.spthy" lower=34 upper=43}
~~~~

Note that the state fact has several parameters: the unique thread identifier
`~tid`^[Note that we could have re-used `~eskI` for this purpose, since it will
also be unique for each instance.], the agent identities `$I` and `$R`, and the
actor's long-term private key `~lkI`, and the private exponent. This now enables
us to specify the second initiator rule.

~~~~ {.tamarin slice="code/Naxos.spthy" lower=45 upper=54}
~~~~

This second rule requires receiving a message `Y` from the network but also
that an initiator fact was previously generated. This rule then consumes this
fact, and since there are no further steps in the protocol, does not need to
output a similar fact. As the `Init_1` fact is instantiated with the same
parameters, the second step will use the same agent identities and the exponent
`exI` computed in the first step.

Thus, the complete example becomes:

~~~~ {.tamarin include="code/Naxos.spthy"}
~~~~

Note that the protocol description only specifies a model, but not which
properties it might satisfy. We discuss these in the next section.
